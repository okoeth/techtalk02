# Enso Tech Talk 02

This repo provides a comprehensive containerised data science environment so that first steps in 
Jupyter Notebooks can be taken without the burden of heavy local installations like Anaconda.
There are two options to run the samples from this tech talk:

## Run locally in Docker
You can simply build and run the container with
```
./build.sh
./run.sh
```

## Run remotely in My Binder
In case you have not Docker installed or want to try this from an iPad or another mobile device, 
you can also run the container in a remote web service called My Binder:
